#### In Program:

In the program you will be prompted for sets of words. Each set will be run through one of 3 algorithms:

1. No Vowels - Removes all vowels in all words input, ex. "buy stuff" -> "bystff"
2. Abbreviate - Removes all letters but capitals, ex. "YouTube" -> "YT"
3. Swap - Swaps the first and last letters of the first word and discards all other words, ex. "hello world" -> "oellh"

When all word sets you wish to be present in the password have been input, use **-d** to exit. 
Your finished password will be output. This password is ***NOT SAVED*** so please make sure to remember it or write it down somewhere.

Note: Do NOT use any non-ascii characters! Unicode characters such as "Ï‰" are not supported for use in this program and will cause an error.
